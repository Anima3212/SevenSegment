{"name":"Sevensegment","tagline":"Arduino library to control common-anode 7-segment display","body":"# arduino_7_segment_display_library\r\nThis library was written originally to be used with 7-Segment-Display YSD-160AR4B-8\r\n\r\nInstalling this Library\r\n=====\r\n\r\n1. Download this library by clicking download zip at the top right of this repository or cloning the repository to your computer.\r\n\r\n2. In the arduino IDE: Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP library : and go to where the zip file you downloaded is located. Done!\r\n\r\n3. When you want to use this library, just include the library @ Sketch -> Include Library in the Arduino IDE and you are good to go!\r\n\r\nHow to use this library\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis is the correct pinout diagram of the YSD-160AR4B-8.\r\n\r\n```\r\n10, 9, CA, 7, 6\r\n ____________\r\n|            |\r\n|            |\r\n|            |\r\n|            |\r\n|            |\r\n|____________|\r\n1, 2, CA, 4, 5\r\n```\r\n```C\r\n/*\r\n *Initialize SevenSegment\r\n *Put the number of the digitalPin from the arduino connected to the 7-Segment in order\r\n *For example, I use digitalPin 2 connected to pin 1 on the 7-Segment, digitalPin 3 to pin2, 4 to 4\r\n *5 to 5, 6 to 6, 7 to 7, 8 to 9, and 9 to 10\r\n */\r\nSegmentDisplay segmentDisplay(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How to display a hex letter with/without decimal point**\r\n```C\r\n/*Display any given hex number 0 to 15\r\n *2 with no decimal and C with decimal point in this example\r\n */\r\nsegmentDisplay.displayHex(2, false);\r\nsegmentDisplay.displayHex(12, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Display only the decimal point**\r\n```C\r\n/*Display only the decimal point*/\r\nsegmentDisplay.displayDecimalPoint();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How to test the display and test display wiring**\r\n```C\r\n/*Test the given display and display wiring by rotating through numbers 0 - F*/\r\nsegmentDisplay.testDisplay();\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Wiring\r\n=====\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://github.com/dgduncan/arduino_7_segment_display_library/blob/master/extras/fritzing_image.png \"Example Wiring Diagram\")\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n=====\r\n\r\n1.
